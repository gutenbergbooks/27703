	<h2 class="title">The Concord Symposium and their Greatest Contribution to Philosophy.</h2>

	<p>Let no one accuse the critic of irreverence, who doubts the wisdom
	of universities, and of pedantic scholars who burrow like moles
	in the mouldering remnants of antiquity, but see nothing of the
	glorious sky overhead. While I have no reverence for barren or
	wasted intellect, I have the profoundest respect for the fruitful
	intellect which produces valuable results—for the vast energy of
	the lower class of intellectual powers, which have developed our
	immense wealth of the physical sciences and their useful applications.
	Indescribably grand they are. The mathematicians, chemists,
	geologists, astronomers, botanists, zoologists, anatomists, and
	the numerous masters of dynamic sciences and arts, have lifted the
	world out of the ruder elements of barbarism and suffering.</p>

	<p>But, as for the class of speculative talkers, whose self-sufficiency
	prompts them to assume the name of philosophers, to which they
	have no right, what have they ever done either to promote human
	welfare, or to assist human enlightenment and reveal the mysteries
	of life? Have they not always been as blind as owls, bats, and
	moles, to daylight progress? Are they not at this time utterly and
	<em>unconsciously</em> blind to the progress of spiritual sciences, to the revelations
	of psychometry and anthropology—placing themselves,
	indeed, in that hopeless class who are too ignorant to know their
	ignorance, too far in the dark to know or suspect that there is any
	light?</p>

	<p>A remnant of these worshippers of antiquity still holds its seances
	at Concord, Mass., and publishes its amazingly dry <cite>Journal of Speculative
	Philosophy</cite>. With the unconscious solemnity of earnestness,
	it still digs into Aristotle’s logic and speculations—the dryest material
	that was ever used to benumb the brains of young collegians,
	and teach them how <em>not to reason</em>, for Aristotle never had a glimmering
	conception of what the process of reasoning is. Yet all Concordians
	are not Aristotelians; some of them have more modern
	ideas, and a vigorous, though misdirected, mentality.</p>

	<p>Prof. W. T. Harris, the leader of the Concordians, to whose lucubrations
	the newspapers give ample space, as those of the representative
	man, made a second attempt to explore the Aristotelian darkness,
	in which his first essay was totally lost.</p>

	<p>If there is but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous, it is not
	even a step from the absurd to the ludicrous and amusing. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>professional wit or joker is never so richly amusing as the man who
	is utterly unconscious that he is in the least funny, while heroically
	in earnest. The professed comedian never furnishes so much amusement
	as the would-be heroic tragedian, who, like the Count Joannes,
	furnishes uproarious merriment for the whole evening.</p>

	<p>I have seen nothing in our Boston newspapers quite so amusing as
	the very friendly and sympathetic report of Prof. Harris’ most elaborate
	and laborious comments on the <span class="small_all_caps">SYLLOGISMS</span>, which reminds
	one of Hopkinson’s metaphysical and elaborate disquisition on the
	nature, properties, relations, and essential entity of a salt-box. We
	do not laugh at the professor as we did at Daniel Pratt, the “Great
	American Traveller,” whose travels are now ended; for, aside from
	his metaphysical follies, Prof. Harris is a man of real merit and
	great intellectual industry, whose services in education will entitle
	him to be remembered; but when the metaphysical impulse
	seizes him,</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>“Who would not laugh if such a fool there be,</p>
	<p>Who would not weep if Atticus were he.”</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>The lecture of Prof. Harris was reported in the <cite>Boston Herald</cite>, in
	the style of a gushing girl with her first lover, as a “<strong class="emphasis">New Step in
	the History of Philosophy</strong>,” attended by a full audience as “a
	rare treat” “<em>like buckwheat-cakes fresh from the griddle</em>,” for “Prof.
	Harris took a decidedly <em>new step in Philosophy</em>,” giving “an insight
	which <em>no philosopher, ancient or modern, has attained</em>.” Again,
	speaking of it privately, Prof. Harris said, “I got hold of the idea
	three or four years ago, and I have been trying to work it out since.
	I regard it as my <em>best contribution to philosophy</em>.” “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Montes parturiunt</em>,”
	What do they bring forth? Is it a mouse of respectable size?
	The <cite>Boston Herald</cite>, which is generally smart, though never profound,
	says of the symposium, “It has set up Aristotle this year as its
	golden calf to be worshipped.” “But when you ask the question,
	what does all this talk amount to, it is difficult to give an affirmative
	answer.” “It is simply threshing straw over, again and again.” But it
	is not aware that the Concord straw is merely the dried weeds that
	Lord Bacon cut up and threw out of the field of respectable literature
	over two hundred and sixty years ago. “What man (says the
	<cite>Herald</cite>), with any serious purpose in life, has any time to waste over
	what somebody thinks Aristotle ought to have thought or said.”
	And my readers may ask, why give the valuable space of the <cite class="name">Journal
	of Man</cite> to examining such trash? Precisely because <em>it is
	trash</em>, and yet occupies a place of honor, standing in the way of
	progress and representing the tendencies of education for centuries,
	which still survive, though they may be said to have gone to seed.
	Concord represents University philosophy, as a dude represents
	fashion, and as University philosophy is a haughty antagonist of all
	genuine philosophy, it is important to illustrate its worthlessness.</p>

	<p>The subject of Prof. Harris’ lecture was “Aristotle’s Theory of
	the Syllogism, Compared with that of Hegel.” As these two were
	the great masters of obscurantism, the lecture should have been, of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>course, as perfect a specimen as either of darkness and emptiness.
	Omitting the definitions of syllogisms, which are familiar to all collegians,
	but too intolerably tedious to be inflicted on my readers, we
	find a very unexpected specimen of common sense following the talk
	about syllogisms, which embodied Aristotle’s ideas of Reason. Here
	it is: “Logic is often called the art of reasoning, and many people
	study it with a view to mastering an art of correct thinking, hoping
	thereby to get an instrument useful in the acquirement of truth. It
	may be doubted, however, whether the mind gets much aid in the
	pursuit of truth by studying logic.” There is no doubt at all about
	it,—not one rational individual out of a hundred thousand collegians
	will confess that he ever got any benefit in reasoning or in
	pursuing truth from Aristotle’s syllogistic formula. “All men are
	mortal—Socrates is a man, and therefore Socrates is mortal.”</p>

	<p>Why, then, such a flourish of trumpets over some new trick in
	playing with syllogism, when the whole thing is utterly worthless?
	And the Professor upsets himself in his own lecture, thus: “If the
	middle tub is contained in the big tub, and the little tub is contained
	in the middle tub, then the little tub is contained in the big tub.”
	Hegel says: “Common sense in its reaction against such logical
	formality and artificiality turned away in disgust, and was of the
	opinion that it could do without such a science as logic.” Most true,
	Philosopher Hegel, you have absurdities of your own on a gigantic
	scale, but you do well to reject the petty absurdities of Aristotle.</p>

	<p>How does Prof. Harris rise up from Hegel’s fatal blow? He rises
	like Antæus from touching the earth, and triumphantly shows that
	syllogisms are the most necessary of all things to humanity in its
	mundane existence; that, in fact, we have all been syllogizing ever
	since we left the maternal bosom to look at the cradle, the cat, and
	the dog. In fact we never could have grown up to manhood, much
	less to be Concordian philosophers, if we had not been syllogizing all
	the days of our life, and, indeed, it is probable we shall continue
	syllogizing to all eternity, in the next life, if we have any growth
	in knowledge at all. Blessed be the memory of Aristotle, the great
	original and unrivalled discoverer of the syllogism, by means of
	which all human knowledge has been built up, and “blessed be the
	man (as Sancho Panza said) who first invented sleep,” by which we
	are relieved, to rest after the mighty labors of the syllogism.</p>

	<p>And lo! we have been syllogizing all these years, alike when we
	listen to the nocturnal yowl of the tomcat, and to the morning song
	of the lark; alike, when we smell the rose, seize the orange, or devour
	the tempting oyster. In syllogism do we live and move, and
	have our being. This is the grand discovery—the last great contribution
	to philosophy from Concord’s greatest philosopher. We suddenly
	discover that we have been syllogizing like philosophers, as
	Mrs. Malaprop discovered that her children had been speaking English.
	The illustration of this overwhelming discovery is peculiarly
	happy, for he applies it to the discovery of a red flannel rag in the
	back yard or garden, and, after detecting the red flannel by syllogism,
	he advances to the grander problem of showing how, by philosophic
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>methods, we can actually distinguish an old tin can from an
	elephant. To enjoy this fully, the reader must take it himself from
	the reported lecture.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“The act of recognition is an unconscious syllogistic process in the
		second figure of the syllogism. I perceive something scarlet in the
		garden. So far I recognize a host of attributes; it is a real object;
		the place, surroundings and color are recognized. The sensations
		were so familiar that the recognition was inconceivably rapid. Then
		comes a slower process. The scarlet is an attribute. What can the
		object be? I think it is a piece of red flannel. The inference
		comes almost to the surface of consciousness, but I have reasoned
		unconsciously: This object is red. A piece of flannel is red; therefore
		this may be a piece of red flannel. The middle term is predicate
		in both premises. The unknown object is red. A familiar object
		(flannel) is red. Hence, I recognize this as flannel. I identify
		the unknown object with what is familiar in my mind. But the
		logician will say that this reasoning is on the invalid mode of the
		second figure, from which you can never draw an affirmative conclusion.
		Precisely so, if you mean a necessary conclusion. But
		sense-perception uses affirmative modes of the second figure
		and derives probable knowledge therefrom. I make probable
		knowledge more certain by verifying the inference or correcting
		it. I go to the garden and pick up the object, and see the threads
		and fiber of the wool. Or perhaps I find it was a piece of red
		paper. But whatever it was, at the end I can say what I have seen,
		only in so far as I have recognized or identified it. Recognition proceeds
		by the second figure, and has chiefly the non-valid modes.
		But it may use the valid modes, though in a still less conscious manner.
		For instance, I recognized that the object was not an elephant by
		this valid form; every elephant is larger than a tin can; this object
		is not larger than a tin can; therefore, this object is necessarily not
		an elephant; or, by this other valid form, no elephant is as small as a
		tomato can; this object is just the size of a tomato can; hence this
		object is not an elephant. Had some one told me to look out and
		see an elephant, my perception would unconsciously have taken one
		of these forms. The scarlet is recognized as such only as it is identified
		with a previous impression of scarlet. Here is our third surprise
		in psychology. Unless there were a priori idea, sense-perception
		could never begin. More, unless there were a priori idea, it
		could not begin. For there must be two recognitions before there
		can be a first new idea from sense-perception. The fourth surprise
		is that directly with the first activity of perception in the second
		figure of the syllogism is joined a second activity which takes place
		in the form of the first figure of the syllogism. As soon as I perceived
		the red object to be a piece of flannel, I at once reinforced
		my sense-perception by unlocking all my previous store of knowledge
		stored up under the category of red flannel. I unconsciously
		syllogized thus: ‘All red flannel has threads of warp and woof and
		a rough texture, caused by the coarse fibres of wool curling up
		stiffly; this is a piece of red flannel; hence this will be found to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>have these properties.’ The act of recognition is a subsumption of the
		object under a class by use of the second figure of the syllogism.</p>

		<p>“Now begins the syllogistic activity under the form of the third

		recognizes the general classes by the primary activity in the form of
		the second figure. These attributes are collected around the object
		as a centre of interest, and it is now the middle term. These

	<p>As we have now reached the seventh heaven of Concord philosophy,
	and know how to distinguish an old tin can from an elephant,
	let us rest in peace, to meditate and enjoy its serene delights. We
	have had the supreme satisfaction of listening to the modern Plato,
	the leader at Concord. The <cite>Herald</cite> has informed us that on another
	day “the school listened with great satisfaction to Prof. Harris, who
	is constantly adding to the deep impression he has already made, and
	to the high opinion in which he is held as the most acute and profound
	thinker of the times, in his field.”</p>

	<p>Lest the reader should fail to see in the foregoing what the <em>great
	contribution</em> to philosophy is, let us look in the <cite>Open Court</cite> of
	Chicago, which has a most affectionate partiality for metaphysical
	mystery. It says this “Best contribution to philosophy” “may be
	summed up thus,” “We can perceive nothing but what we can identify
	with what was familiar already.” If this were true, the babe
	could never perceive anything, as it begins without any knowledge,
	and it would be impossible for us to learn anything or acquire any
	new ideas. This is rather an amusing <em>discovery</em>! but it is barely
	possible or conceivable that there are some old fossils whose minds
	are in that melancholy condition.</p>

	<p>P. S. After a few hours of repose to recover from mental fatigue
	and digest the new wisdom so suddenly let loose upon mankind, we
	discover the new aspect of the world of (Concord) philosophy.
	The great question of the future will be to syllogize or not to syllogize.
	Is it possible to distinguish an elephant from a tin can by any
	other method than the syllogism? When that question is decisively
	settled, if it ever can be settled (for metaphysical questions generally
	last through the centuries) Prof. Harris will have an opportunity
	to win still brighter laurels, and make still greater contributions
	to philosophy, by finding more syllogisms. Will he not prove that
	mathematics is the sphere of syllogism also, for if two and two make
	four, does not the conception of four assume the position of the
	major predicate, which is the generalized idea of one to a quadruple
	extent, and also of twos duplicated. Thus the major predicate, that
	four is two twos, involves the minor that two is the half of four and
	consequently that twice two is four. Q. E. D. The syllogism is
	irresistible.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>If Prof. Harris should establish the mathematical syllogism and
	extend its power through all the realms of mathematics, as so industrious
	a thinker might easily do, he will have taken a step far in advance
	of Plato, and justly deserve a higher rank, for Plato (see his Phædo)
	was terribly puzzled over the question how one and one make two.
	After much puzzling he decided finally that one and one became
	two “by <em>participation in duality</em>.” This was the first great step to
	introduce philosophy into mathematics. Let Prof. Harris consummate
	this great work either by syllogism or by “<em>participation</em>.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps he may introduce us to a still greater “surprise” by
	showing that all metaphors and poetical figures of speech are constructed
	on syllogistic principles. It can be done, but we must not
	lift the veil of wisdom too hastily, or rush in where Concord philosophers
	“fear to tread.” They have an endless future feast in the
	syllogisms, if they are faithful followers of Prof. Harris. But possibly
	there may be others attracted to Concord who would give the
	school something less dry than metaphysics, or, some other sort of
	metaphysics. One of their most esteemed orators made a diversion
	from the syllogism by presenting some other idea based on Aristotle,
	which ought to eclipse the syllogism, for, according to the report, he
	said “It is the most <em>momentous question that can engage the human
	attention</em>. It involves the <em>reality of God</em>, of personal existence, and
	freedom among men, and of immortality.”</p>

	<p>Immense it must be! Dominic Sampson would surely say “<em>Prodigious!</em>”
	An attentive study of the obscure phraseology of this
	philosopher enables one to discover that the great and tragical question
	concerns the reality of reality, or what the reality is, and
	whether it is real or not, and how we can find it out. The way to
	find out whether that which we think is, is or is not, is to go back to
	Aristotle, who is the only man that ever understood the is-ness of
	the is. As the lecturer is reported to say, “The <em>first sign</em> of a movement
	in the right direction is the serious attention now being devoted
	in many quarters to the writings of Aristotle, who, in this, as in
	many other things, will long remain the master of those that know.”
	Evidently those that don’t go to Aristotle don’t know anything about
	life, freedom, God and immortality. How unfortunate we are, and
	how fortunate the professor is, must appear by his answer to the
	great question, reported as follows: “Prof. Davidson discussed at
	length the nature of phenomena, taking the underlying basis that
	time and space are relations of the real to the phenomenal, and nothing
	but relations; also that we not only have ideas of reality, but
	that <em>these ideas are the realities themselves</em>. Then the question is, if
	the <em>concept of reality be reality itself</em>, how is this related to phenomena?
	There is a double relation, active and passive. * * * Eternal realities
	are known to us only as terms of phenomena. They are in ourselves,
	and from the exigencies of our intelligence.”</p>

	<p>Thus we understand nothing whatever exists but our own cogitations,
	or, as the sailor jocosely expressed it—“’Tis all in my eye”—and
	after these many years we are brought back to the famous expression
	of the Boston Transcendentalist, “we should not say <em>it rains,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>it snows</em>, we should say <em>I rain, I snow</em>.” This, gentle, patient reader,
	is no burlesque, that you have been reading, it is the wisdom of the
	Concord Symposium of professors and authors meeting near the end
	of the 19th century, and basking in the smiles of <em>cultured</em> Boston!
	or at least that portion which is devoted to the Bostonese idea of
	philosophy, and thinks the feeblest glimmer of antiquity worth more
	than the science of to-day. Such indeed are the sentiments of the
	President of Boston University. And as for the wisdom of Concord,
	the <cite>Open Court</cite>, which is good authority, says: “Dr. Harris and
	Prof. Davidson are, without doubt, the <em>pillars of the school</em>; but there
	is some difference of opinion as to which is its <em>indispensable support</em>.”
	An intelligent spectator would say that more metaphysical
	acumen and vigor has been displayed by <em class="name">Dr. Edward Montgomery</em>
	than by all the remainder of those engaged in the blind hunt
	for philosophy at Concord.</p>

	<p>On the last day of the Symposium, July 28, the report says “The
	burden has fallen wholly upon Prof. Harris, and he has borne it so
	as to excite the <em>wonder and admiration</em> of his listeners. He <em>went to
	the very bottom of things</em> as far as human thought could go, and
	there, as he put it, was on solid rock, with no possibility of scepticism.
	Both his forenoon and evening lectures were <em>masterly in
	their way</em>.” Exactly so; they were unsurpassed as a reproduction
	of the style and manner of the Aristotelian folly which held Europe
	fast in that wretched period called the Dark Ages, which preceded
	the dawn of intelligence with Galileo.</p>

	<p>About one half of the reported lectures on Aristotle is, though
	cloudy, intelligible. The remainder is a fair specimen of that skimmy-dashy
	style of thought which glances over the surfaces of
	things and never reaches their substance or reality, yet boasts of its
	unlimited profundity because it does not know the meaning of profound.
	Such thinking must necessarily end in falsity and folly, of
	which the lecture gives many specimens, which it is worth while to
	quote, to show what the devotees of antiquity call philosophy—thus:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“If we cannot know the ultimate nature of being, then philosophy
		is impossible, for philosophy differs from other kind of knowing
		by seeking a first principle.” “The objects of philosophy then
		include those of ontology. They are first the nature of the ultimate
		being of the universe, the first principle, the idea of God.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This is not philosophy, but might be called theology, and not legitimate
	theology even, but supra-theological—for all sane theology
	admits that man cannot know God. It is a desperate, insane suggestion
	that we must know the unknowable, and that if we cannot do
	that we can have no philosophy. Of course men who think this
	way know nothing of philosophy, and are beyond the reach of
	reason.</p>

	<p>Again, “in the nature of the truly independent and true being, it
	sees necessary transcendence of space and time, and this is essential
	immortality.” This is a fair specimen of the skimmy-dashy style.
	Immortality is not a “transcendence of space,” if that means anything
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>at all, but a conscious existence without end. Perhaps by
	“transcendence of space” he means filling all the space there is, and
	going considerably beyond it where there is no space.</p>

	<p>His idea of infinity is worthy of Aristotle or Hegel, to whom, in
	fact, it belongs—he says, “self-conditioning is the form of the whole,
	the form of that <em>which is its own other</em>.” That something should
	be “its own other” is just as clear as that it should be its own
	mother or father. Do such expressions represent any ideas, or do
	metaphysicians use words as a substitute for ideas—verily they do,
	in Hegelian metaphysics, and the same thing is done in asylums for
	the insane.</p>

	<p>Again, “our knowledge of quantity is a knowledge of what is
	universal and necessary, and <em>hence</em> is not derived from experience.”
	If this is true of the professor, he knew all of mathematics before
	he opened his eyes in the cradle. Common mortals know nothing
	of quantity or anything else, until they have had a little experience.
	If we know everything that is “universal and necessary” without
	experience, the little babes must be very wise indeed.</p>

	<p>Again, “causal energy is essentially a <em>self-separation</em>, for in order
	that a cause A. may produce an effect in B. outside of it, cause A.
	must detach or separate from itself the influence or energy which
	modifies B.” What does the earth <em>detach from itself</em> when it causes
	a heavy body to fall? In chemical catalysis what does the second
	body “detach from itself” to produce change in the first, which is
	changed by its mere presence. The assertion is but partially true,
	applying only to the transfer of force when one body strikes
	another. Aristotle has some thoroughly absurd suggestions on the
	same subject which Professor H. did not reproduce.</p>

	<p>How does he grapple with the idea of God, which is the essence of
	his philosophy? Here it is: “The first principle as pure self-activity,
	must necessarily have the permanent form of <em>knowing of
	knowing</em>, for this root form of self-consciousness is entirely self-related.
	The self sees the essential self, the self-activity is the object of self.”
	We are instructed! God <em>knows he knows</em>, and that is the very
	essence of his divinity—that is enough. In this profound expression
	we have the consummation of philosophy, for the purpose of his
	philosophy is to know God, “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc dimittis</em>,” we need to know
	nothing more,—<em>we know we know</em>, and so we are God’s. “This
	line of thought brought up at every step some phase of Plato and
	Aristotle,” said the professor, and we are thankful that he did not
	resurrect any more of the puerilities of Athenian ignorance. “Knowing
	of knowing” is quite enough, which he repeats to be emphatic.
	“All true being is in the form of the infinite or self-related, and
	related to itself as the <em>knowing of knowing</em>. All beings that are not
	this perfect form of self-knowing, either potentially or actually, must
	be parts of a system or world order which is produced in some way
	by true being or self-knowing. All potential self-knowings contain
	within themselves the <em>power to realize</em> their self-knowledge, and are
	therefore free beings.” This is a broad hint that men are gods and
	lands us in that realm of folly of which Mrs. Eddy is the presiding
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>genius. She is much indebted to the Concord philosophers for lending
	their respectability to her labyrinth of self-contradictions.</p>

	<p>One quotation more, to give the essence of this Concord philosophy.
	“The Divine Being exists for himself as one object. This
	gives us the Logos, or the only-begotten. The Logos <em>knows himself</em>
	as personal perfection, and also as <em>generated</em>, though in an infinite
	past time. This is its recognition of its first principle and its
	unbegotten ‘Father.’ But whatever it knows in self-consciousness,
	it creates or makes to exist,” and more of the same sort.</p>

	<p>We are overwhelmed with such a flood of wisdom! How the
	professor attained so intimate, familiar, and perfect a knowledge of the
	infinite power, to which the fathomless depths of starry infinity are
	as nothing, is a great mystery. Was it by <em>Kabbala</em> or by <em>Thaumaturgy</em>,
	or did he follow the sublime instructions of his great
	brother Plato, and thrust his head through the revolving dome
	of the universe, where the infinite truth is seen in materialized
	forms.</p>

	<p>The “Divine” Plato (of whom Emerson said, “Plato is philosophy,
	and philosophy is Plato”) described the immortal Gods as driving
	up in chariots through the dome of the heavens to <em>get upon the roof</em>,
	and look abroad at infinite truth, as they stand or drive upon the
	revolving dome, followed by <em>ambitious souls who barely get their heads
	through the roof</em> with difficulty, and catch a hasty glimpse of infinite
	truth, before they tumble back, or lame their wings, or perhaps drop
	into the body of some brute. The revolving dome and the ambitious
	souls peeping through the roof, would be a good subject for the
	next symposium. They might tell us whether these ambitious souls
	that peep through the roof are Concordian philosophers, or belong
	to the schools of Aquinas and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duns Scotus</em>.</p>

	<p>The philosophy of the Greeks is worth no more to-day than their
	chemistry or their physiology. The lingering superstition of
	believing because they had famous warriors, orators, statesmen,
	historians, poets, and sculptors, while entirely ignorant of science
	and philosophy, that their philosophic puerilities are worthy of
	adoration in the 19th century, a superstition which makes a fetish
	of the writings of Plato and Aristotle, has been tolerated long
	enough, and as no one has attempted to give a critical estimate of
	this effete literature since Lord Bacon did something in that way, I
	shall not much longer postpone this duty.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>Human Longevity.</h2>

	<p>Is not longevity in some sense a measure of true civilization or
	improvement of the race? It is certainly an evidence of conformity
	to the Divine laws of life and health, which reward right
	action with happiness, health, and long life. I cannot, therefore,
	think the study of longevity unimportant. To every one of us it
	is a vital question, for death is regarded as the greatest calamity,
	and is the severest penalty of angry enemies, or of outraged laws.</p>

	<p>It is our duty as well as privilege to perfect our constitution, and
	see that it does not wear out too soon, that we are not prematurely
	called away from our duties. And I bring it as serious charge
	against modern systems of education, that they tend to degenerate
	mankind, to impair the constitution and to shorten life. That we
	should not submit to this, but should all aspire to live a century or
	longer, if we have a fair opportunity, I seriously maintain, and that
	my readers may be inspired with a like determination, I take pleasure
	in quoting examples.</p>

	<p>In Dr. Cohausen’s <cite class="name">Hermippus Redivivus</cite> republished in 1744,
	I find the following statements: “It is very remarkable, that not
	only the sacred writers, but all the ancient Chaldean, Egyptian, and
	Chinese authors speak of the great ages of such as lived in early
	times, and this with such confidence that Xenophon, Pliny, and
	other judicious persons receive their testimony without scruple. But
	to come down to later times, Attila, King of the Huns, who reigned
	in the fifth century, lived to 124, and then died of excess, the first
	night of his second nuptials with one of the most beautiful princesses
	of that age. Piastus, King of Poland, who from the rank of a peasant
	was raised to that of a prince, in the year 824, lived to be 120, and
	governed his subjects with such ability to the very last, that his
	name is still in the highest veneration amongst his countrymen.
	Marcus Valerius Corvinus, a Roman Consul, was celebrated as a true
	patriot and a most excellent person in private life, by the elder
	Cato, and yet Corvinus was then upwards of a hundred. Hippocrates,
	the best of physicians lived to an 104, but Asclepiades, a Persian
	physician, reached 150. Galen lived in undisturbed health to 104;
	Sophocles, the tragic poet, lived to 130; Democritus, the philosopher,
	lived to 104; and Euphranor taught his scholars at upward of 100;
	and yet what are these to Epiminedes of Crete, who, according to
	Theopompus, an unblemished historian, lived to upwards of 157. I
	mention these, because, if there be any truth or security in history,
	we may rely as firmly on the facts recorded of them as on any facts
	whatever. Pliny gives an account that in the city of Parma, there
	were two of 130 years of age, three of 120, at a certain taxation, or
	rather visitation, and in many cities of Italy, people much older,
	particularly at Ariminium, one Marcus Apponius, who was 150.
	Vincent Coquelin, a clergyman, died at Paris in 1664, at 112.
	Lawrence Hutland, lived in the Orkneys to 170. James Sands,
	an Englishman, towards the latter end of the last century, died
	at 140, and his wife at 120. In Sweden, it is a common thing to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>meet with people above 100, and Rudbekius affirms from bills of
	mortality signed by his brother, who was a bishop, that in the
	small extent of twelve parishes, there died in the space of thirty-seven
	years, 232 men, between 100 and 140 years of age, which is
	the more credible, since in the diet assembled by the late Queen
	of Sweden, in 1713, the oldest and best speaker among the
	deputies from the order of Peasants was considerably above 100.
	These accounts, however, are far short of what might be produced
	from Africa and North America, that I confine myself to such
	accounts as are truly authentic.” All of these instances the doctor
	sustains by reference to his authorities.</p>

	<p>To the foregoing he adds the examples of teachers and persons who
	associate with the young, to which he ascribes great value in promoting
	longevity. Thus, “Gorgias, the master of Isocrates, and many other
	eminent persons, lived to be 108. His scholar, Isocrates, in the 94th
	year of his age published a book, and survived the publication four
	years, in all which time he betrayed not the least failure, either in
	memory or in judgment; he died with the reputation of being the
	most eloquent man in Greece. Xenophilus, an eminent Pythagorean
	philosopher, taught a numerous train of students till he arrived at
	the age of 105, and even then enjoyed a very perfect health, and left
	this world before his abilities left him. Platerus tells us that his
	grandfather, who exercised the office of a preceptor to some young
	nobleman, married a woman of thirty when he was in the 100th
	year of his age. His son by this marriage did not stay like his
	father, but took him a wife when he was twenty; the old man was
	in full health and spirits at the wedding, and lived six years afterward.
	Francis Secordo Horigi, usually distinguished by the name
	of Huppazoli, was consul for the State of Venice in the island of
	Scio, where he died in the beginning of 1702, when he was very near
	115. He married in Scio when he was young, and being much
	addicted to the fair sex, he had in all five wives, and fifteen or
	twenty concubines, all of them young, beautiful women, by whom
	he had forty-nine sons and daughters, whom he educated with the
	utmost tenderness, and was constantly with them, as much as his
	business would permit. He was never sick. His sight, hearing,
	memory, and activity were amazing. He walked every day about
	eight miles; his hair, which was long and graceful, became white by
	the time that he was four-score, but turned black at 100, as did his
	eyebrows and beard at 112. At 110 he lost all his teeth, but the
	year before he died he cut two large ones with great pain. His
	food was generally a few spoonfuls of broth, after which he ate some
	little thing roasted; his breakfast and supper, bread and fruit; his
	constant drink, distilled water, without any addition of wine or
	other strong liquor to the very last. He was a man of strict honor,
	of great abilities, of a free, pleasant, and sprightly temper, as we are
	told by many travellers, who were all struck with the good sense
	and good humor of this polite old man.”</p>

	<p>“In the same country (as Thomas Parr) lived the famous
	Countess of Desmond. From deeds, settlements, and other indisputable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>testimonies it appeared clearly that she was upwards of 140,
	according to the computation of the great Lord Bacon, who knew
	her personally, and remarks this particularity about her, that she
	thrice changed her teeth.”</p>

	<p>The stern scepticism of the medical profession and especially
	among its leaders has borne so heavily against all cheerful views of
	life and longevity, that at the risk of becoming monotonous I again
	refer to this subject and present examples of longevity which cannot
	be denied, in addition to the list previously given. Medical collegiate
	scepticism can deny anything. Ultra sceptics deny centenarian
	life, as they also denied the existence of hydrophobia, while those who
	admitted its existence denied its curability.</p>

	<p>Connecticut alone furnishes a good supply of centenarians. Three
	years ago Mr. Frederick Nash, of Westport, Conn, published a
	pamphlet giving the old people living in Connecticut, including
	twenty-three centenarians, whom he described. The names of
	twelve of these were as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Edmund R. Kidder, of Berlin, Aug. 17, 1784.</li>
		<li>Jeremiah Austin, Coventry, Feb. 10, 1783.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Lucy Luther, Hadlyme, Jan. 6, 1784.</li>
		<li>Walter Pease, Enfield, March 29, 1784.</li>
		<li>Egbert Cowles, Farmington, April 4, 1785.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Eunice Hollister, Glastonbury, Aug. 9, 1784.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Elsie Chittenden, Guilford, April 24, 1784.</li>
		<li>Miss Eunice Saxton, Colchester, Sept. 6, 1784.</li>
		<li>Marvin Smith, Montville, Nov. 18, 1784.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Phebe Briggs, Sherman, Nov. 16, 1784.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Elizabeth Buck, Wethersfield, Jan. 10, 1784.</li>
		<li>Mrs. Clarissa D. Raymond, Milton, April 22, 1782.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The others are either of foreign birth or former slaves, whose
	precise ages cannot be established.</p>

	<p>In addition to this list the newspapers gave us Mrs. Abigail Ford
	of Washington, born in 1780, Mr. Darby Green of Reading, born in
	1779, Tryphena Jackson, colored, born in 1782, and Wm. Hamilton,
	Irish, also in 1782; and an old sailor in New Haven town house
	claims to have been born in 1778.</p>

	<p>The very careful investigation of Connecticut by Mr. Nash shows
	that “the duration of human life in this State is greater than it was
	a generation ago. Then only one person in 500 lived to see 80
	years. Now one per cent of the population live to that age. The
	average age of 6,223 persons is 83 years. The number of ages ranging
	from 84 to 89 years is large, and those who are 90 and over number
	651; nine are 99, thirteen are 98, and eleven are 97. No age of
	less than 80 years has been recorded.</p>

	<p>“It may be pleasing to our grandmothers to know that in this list of
	more than 6,000, more than 4,000 are women, and that only eight of the
	twenty centenarians are men. The list adds strength to what has
	already been held as true, that married people always live longer than
	single, and it also shows that two spinsters have begun their second
	century. They are accompanied on the list by two sturdy bachelors.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>In a sketch of centenarians published in November, 1884, are

	<p>In looking over my records I find so many other examples of centenarian

	but examples running for over a century may be worth mentioning.
	Madame Lacene, one of the most brilliant women of France, died a
	few years ago at Lyons in her 104th year. Her will was under contest
	on account of her extreme age, but the court was fully satisfied
	of her intellectual competence. In the olden time she had often entertained
	Mme. de Stael, Mme. Recamier, and Benj. Constant.</p>

	<p>The oldest person in France, perhaps in the world, is said to be a
	woman who lives in the village of Auberive, in Royans. She was
	born March 16, 1761, and is therefore 125 years old. The authentic
	record of her birth is to be found in the parish register of St. Just
	de Claix, in the department of the Isere.—<cite>Scientific American.</cite></p>

	<p>“Among the professors at German universities there were no
	fewer than 157 between the ages of seventy and ninety, of whom 122
	still deliver lectures, seven of these being between eighty-five and
	eighty-nine years of age. The oldest, Von Ranke, was in active service
	in his 90th year. Elennich, of Breslau, only thirty-nine days
	younger, still shows energy in anything he puts his hands to.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Henry Alphonse of Concord, Mo., over 105, retained her
	memory and eyesight without glasses till after 104. Mr. Charles
	Crowley died at Suncook, N. H. over 104. Frank Bogkin, a colored
	man of Montgomery, Ala., was believed to be 115 at his death
	recently. When he was about 60 years old, he earned money and
	purchased his freedom. Tony Morgan, a blind negro, was recently
	living at Mobile, 105 years old. Pompey Graham of Montgomery,
	N. Y., lately died at 119, and retained his faculties. Phebe Jenkins
	of Beaufort County, South Carolina, was believed to be 120 years
	old when she died about a year ago. Mrs. Louisa Elgin of Seymour,
	Indiana, whose mother lived to be 115, was recently living at 105.</p>

	<p>“Jennie White, a colored woman, died in St. Joseph, Mo., Monday
	last, aged 122 years. She was born in the eastern part of
	Georgia, and when twenty years of age was taken to Tennessee,
	where she remained for ninety-six years. She had lived in St.
	Joseph about ten years. She was a cook for Captain Waterfall, of
	George Washington’s staff, during the war of the Revolution. She
	remembered the death of Washington well, and used to tell a number
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>of interesting stories about early times. She died in full possession
	of all her mental faculties, but was a cripple and helpless.”</p>

	<p><strong class="headline">Males and Females.</strong>—In the first number of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> it
	was stated that although women were from two to six per cent more
	numerous in population, more males were born by four to sixteen
	per cent. This was a typographical error; it should have been from
	four to six per cent, generally four. The greatest excess of males
	is in illegitimate births. The reversal of proportions in the progress
	of life shows that the male mortality is much greater than the
	female. Hence the more tranquil habits and greater predominance
	of the moral nature in women increases their longevity, while the
	greater indulgence of the passions and appetites, the greater muscular
	and intellectual force among men, are hostile to longevity.
	Hence the establishment of a true religion, or the application of the
	“New Education,” will greatly increase longevity. It will also be
	increased by greater care of health in manufacturing establishments,
	and by diminishing the hours of labor; for exhausting physical
	labor not only shortens life but predisposes to intemperance. The
	injurious effect of excessive toil is shown in the shorter lives of the
	poor, and is enforced by Finlaison’s “Report on Friendly Societies
	to the British Parliament,” which says (p. 211) “The practicable
	difference in the distribution of sickness seems to turn upon the
	amount of the <em>expenditure of physical force</em>. This is no new thing,
	for in all ages the enervation and decrepitude of the bodily frame
	has been observed to follow a prodigal waste of the mental or corporeal
	energies. But it has been nowhere previously established upon
	recorded experience that the quantum of sickness annually falling
	to the lot of man is in a direct proportion to the demands upon his
	muscular power. So it would seem, however.”</p>

	<p>Philanthropists should therefore unite in limiting the hours of daily
	labor to ten or less. But more quiet pursuits have greater endurance;
	women keeping house have no ten hour limit, and the
	editor of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> generally gives more than twelve hours a
	day to his daily labor.</p>

	<p><strong class="headline">A Negro 135 Years Old.</strong>—The St. Louis <cite>Globe Democrat</cite>
	says: James James, a negro, and citizen of the United States, who
	resides at Santa Rosa, Mexico, is probably the oldest man on earth.
	He was born near Dorchester, S. C., in 1752, and while an infant
	was removed to Medway River, Ga., in the same year that Franklin
	brought down electricity from the thunder clouds. In 1772 there
	was quite an immigration into South Carolina, and his master,
	James James (from whom he takes his name), moved near Charleston,
	S. C., in company with a number of his neighbors. On June
	4, 1776, when 24 years of age, a large British fleet, under Sir Peter
	Parker, arrived off Charleston. The citizens had erected a palmetto-wood
	fort on Sullivan’s Island, with twenty-six guns, manned by
	500 troops under Col. Moultrie, and on June 28 the British made
	an attack by land and water, and were compelled to withdraw
	after a ten-hours’ conflict. It was during this fight that Sergeant
	Jasper distinguished himself by replacing the flag, which had been
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>shot away upon the bastion on a new staff. His master, James
	James, manned one of the guns in this fight, and Jim, the subject
	of this sketch, with four other slaves, were employed around the
	fort as general laborers. Jim followed his master throughout the
	war, and was with Gen. Moultrie at Port Royal, S. C., Feb. 3,
	1779, when Moultrie defeated the combined British forces of
	Prevost and Campbell. His master was surrendered by Gen. Lincoln
	at Charleston, S. C., on Feb. 12, 1780, to the British forces, and
	this ends Jim’s military career.</p>

	<p>He remembers of the rejoicing in 1792 throughout the country
	in consequence of Washington’s election to the Presidency, he then
	being 40 years of age. In this year his first master died, aged
	about 60 years. Jim then became the property of “Marse Henry”
	(Henry James), owning large estates and about thirty slaves near
	Charleston. On account of having raised “Marse Henry,” Jim
	was a special favorite with his master, and was allowed to do as
	he chose. His second master, Henry, died in 1815, about 55 years
	of age, and Jim, now at 63 years of age, became the property of
	James James, Henry’s second son. In 1833 the railroad from
	Charleston to Savannah was completed, then the longest railroad
	in the world, and Jim, with his master, took a trip over the road,
	and was shown special favors on account of his age, now 81.
	James James was ten years of age at his father’s death, and when
	he became of age he inherited large estates, slaves, etc., among
	whom were “old Uncle Jim” and his family. James James in
	1855 moved to Texas with all his slaves. He desired that his
	slaves should be free at his death, and in 1858 moved into
	Mexico, so that they could be free before his death. James
	returned to the United States and died in Texas, and in 1865,
	after there were no longer slaves in the United States, Uncle Jim’s
	children and grandchildren returned to the United States. Five
	years ago, at the age of 130, Jim could do light chores, but subsisted
	mostly by contributions from the citizens, but for the past
	two years, not being able to walk, he remains for the most part
	in his little jacal, his wants being supplied by generous neighbors.
	The rheumatism in his legs prevents him from walking.</p>

	<p>So many cases of great longevity have recently been announced,
	that their detailed publication would be tedious. The New York
	<cite>Sun</cite> says: “A town in Cuba prides itself upon being the home of
	eleven women, each of whom is over 100 years of age.” According
	to the census of Germany, December, 1875, there were 160
	persons over 100 years of age, of whom there was one woman
	of 115 years, and another of 117, one man of 118, and another
	of 120. Our own country has a better record of longevity than
	this.</p>

	<p>Let us rest content with the fact that the world has many centenarians,
	and that we too are free to live a hundred years, if our
	ancestors have done their duty in transmitting a good constitution,
	and we have done our duty in preserving it.</p>

	<div id="misc1" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><strong class="headline">An Important Discovery.</strong>—In the New Education I have endeavored
		to show that there are qualities of the atmosphere which science has not yet
		recognized, which are of the highest importance to human health, and that
		an atmosphere may have vitalizing or devitalizing qualities with apparently
		the same chemical composition, because some vitalizing element has been
		added or subtracted.</p>

		<p>This vitalizing element, though analogous to electricity, is not identical
		with it. We find it absent in a room that has been recently plastered, and is
		not quite dry. Sleeping in such a room is positively dangerous. We find the
		same negative depressing condition wherever evaporation has been going on
		in the absence of sunlight, which appears to supply the needful element.</p>

		<p>As evaporation carries off this vitalizing element, precipitation or condensation
		seems to supply it, especially precipitation from the upper regions of
		the atmosphere to which it is carried by evaporation, and to which it is supplied
		by sunshine. Hence we experience a delightful freshness of the
		atmosphere after a summer shower, or on a frosty morning, when the moisture
		is not only precipitated, but condensed into frost. Frost gives off more
		of the exhilarating element of watery vapor than dew, because it is a step
		farther in condensation. Hence there is a healthful, bracing influence in
		cold climates, where all the moisture is firmly frozen, and a very unpleasant,
		depressing influence when a thaw begins. The vicinity of melting snow, or
		a melting iceberg, is unpleasant and promotive of catarrh and pulmonary
		diseases.</p>

		<p>The pleasant influence of the fresh shower ceases when the fallen moisture
		begins to evaporate, and the dewy freshness of the early morn before
		sunrise ceases as the dew evaporates. The most painfully depressing atmosphere
		is that which sometimes comes in cold weather from Northern regions
		which have long been deprived of sunshine.</p>

		<p>This element of health, which physiologists have neglected to investigate,
		has recently been sought by Dr. B. W. Richardson of England. The Popular
		Science News (of Boston) says:—</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“Dr. B. W. Richardson of England, in making some investigations upon
			the physiological effects of breathing pure oxygen by various animals, has
			discovered, that, by simply passing the gas a few times through the lungs,
			it becomes “devitalized,” or incapable of supporting life, although its
			chemical composition remains the same, and all carbonic dioxide and other
			impurities are removed. He also found, that, by passing electric sparks
			through the gas, it became “revitalized,” and regained its usual stimulating
			effect upon the animal economy. The devitalized oxygen would still
			support life in cold-blooded animals, and combustible bodies would burn in it
			as brilliantly as ever. Dr. Richardson considers that, while the gas is in contact
			with the tissues or blood of a warm-blooded animal, some quality essential
			to its life-supporting power is lost. The subject is an interesting and
			important one, and deserves a more thorough investigation.”</p>

		<p><strong class="headline">Jennie Collins</strong> has passed on to her reward above. It would be wrong
		to neglect mentioning the remarkable career of this devoted woman, who
		for thirty-five years has been the guardian angel of the poor and struggling
		women of Boston. Rising from friendless poverty, she became widely
		known as a champion of human rights, and woman’s rights, and, finally, as
		the founder and indefatigable sustainer of that benevolent institution widely
		known as Boffin’s bower. Her literary powers were finely displayed in a

		<p><strong class="headline">Greek Philosophy.</strong>—The essential pedantic stupidity of Aristotle’s
		logic, and its power to belittle and benumb the intelligence of its reverential
		students has been shown in every college where this effete study is kept up.
		We have no better illustration of late than its effect on Prof. Harris, who is
		a very intelligent and useful citizen, but who has been so befogged by such
		studies as to suppose that his pedantic talk about syllogisms embodies an
		important contribution to philosophy, and indeed it was announced as such
		by his reporter. The superstitious reverence for Greek literature is
		impressed on all young collegians, and few recover from it. Sir William
		Hamilton and R. W. Emerson, who were much more intellectual and brilliant
		than Prof. Harris, were as badly afflicted as he with this Greek superstition,
		which has been implanted in school boys so young that it dominates
		their whole lives with the energy of a prenatal condition. The only very
		silly things ever written by the brilliant Emerson were those passages in
		which he speaks of Plato; and the silliest thing in the life of Hamilton is
		the way in which he exulted over some trivial modification of Aristotle’s
		syllogistic ideas, which was about as trivial as that of Prof. Harris, and
		allowed himself to be publicly flattered by one of his students in the most
		fulsome manner for the wonderful profundity of his wisdom, that could even
		add something to the divine wisdom of Aristotle.</p>

		<p>To tell a Greek idolater that the divine Plato thought it a great <span class="small_all_caps">MYSTERY</span>
		that one and one should make two, that he declared it to be incomprehensible
		to him, and thought the only possible solution of the mystery to be,
		that two is produced “by <em>participation in duality</em>,” would surprise him; but
		he would be still more surprised to learn that this is only a specimen brick of
		Plato’s divine philosophy, as it abounds in similar puerilities. I have long
		since reviewed this effete philosophy of an ignorant age, and shown its true
		character, but my work has never been offered to a bookseller. Yet
		it shall not be suppressed. The destruction of stultifying superstitions is as
		necessary in education and literature as in religion. The ponderous blows
		of Lord Bacon upon this Greek superstition of the literary classes did not
		prove fatal, for the same reason that animal organisms of a low, cold-blooded,
		grade are hard to kill,—they must be cut up in fragments before their death
		becomes complete; superstitions and beliefs that have no element of intelligent
		reason, and are perpetuated by social influence, authority, and domination
		over the young become a blind force that resists all influence from reason.</p>

		<p>If my readers are interested in the destruction of venerable and powerful
		falsehoods that stand in the way of every form of progress, I may be
		tempted to publish a cheap edition of my work on Greek Philosophy and
		Logic. It is not in the least presumptuous to lay hands upon this venerable
		illusion, and show that it has not even the vitality of a ghost. It is but a
		simulacrum or mirage, and it is but necessary to approach it fearlessly, and
		walk through it, to discover its essential nonentity.</p>

		to hear the real sentiments of the remainder. It would be equally interesting

		well as a court jester; but I confess I was not aware, until last night, that
		the astrologer of to-day might be as important to one’s movements as one’s
		doctor or one’s lawyer. One of the cleverest and busiest literary men in all

		said, ‘and the more I search, the more convincing proof I find of the influence
		of the stars upon our lives; and now I never begin a new book, or
		take a journey, or, in short, do anything of any importance without consulting
		my astrologer.’ And then he went on to tell me the year in which
		the cholera devastated Naples he had thought of going there. Happily, he
		consulted his astrologer and was warned against it. In accordance with
		the astrologer’s advice, he gave up the journey; and just about the time he

		them also by a new definition of “practicing medicine,” which the new
		statute says shall include all “who shall treat, operate on, or prescribe for any
		physical ailment of another.” This would seem sufficient to protect the
		M. D.’s against all competition, but there is some doubt whether such legislation
		can be enforced, as it is certainly a corrupt and selfish measure that was
		never desired by the people. The <cite>Religio Philosophical Journal</cite> speaks

	<p>There is no great reform, no elevation of humanity without understanding
	MAN,—the laws of his culture, the possibilities within
	his reach, the extent of the short-comings which exist to-day,
	the very numerous agencies of brain-building and soul-culture,
	the wiser methods of the school, the magnetic influences which
	are sometimes all potent, the dietary, the exercises of body and
	voice, the power of music and disciplined example, the lofty outreachings
	for a higher life to which we are introduced by psychometry,
	the supernal and divine influences which may be brought to
	bear, and many nameless things which help to make the aggregate
	omnipotent over young life, but which, alas, are unknown in
	colleges to-day, and will continue unknown until Anthropology
	shall have taken its place as the guide of humanity.</p>

	<hr class="short" />

	<p>P.S.—The doctrine so firmly maintained in this chapter that men
	are incompetent to judge themselves, and need a scientific monitor
	of unquestionable authority, has long been recognized. The Catholic
	confessional is a recognition and application of the principles of
	great value. But the confessional of the narrow-minded and miseducated
	priest should be superseded by the confessional and the
	admonition of Anthropology.</p>

	<p>Sterne, in his Tristam Shandy, says, “Whenever a man’s conscience
	does accuse him (as it seldom errs on that side), he is guilty,
	and unless he is melancholy and hypochondriac, there is always
	sufficient ground for the accusation. But the converse of the proposition
	will not hold true,” that if it does not accuse, the man is
	innocent.</p>

	<p>“Thus conscience, placed on high as a judge within us, and
	intended by our Maker as a just and equitable one too, takes often
	such imperfect cognizance of what passes, does its office so negligently,
	often so corruptly, that it is not to be trusted alone, and,
	therefore, we find there is a necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining
	another principle with it.”</p>

	<p>That “other principle” demanded by Sterne has never been
	found, until, in the revelation of the functions of soul and brain, we
	have found the absolute standard of character, and in Cranioscopy
	and Psychometry the perfect method of applying the principle to
	each individual.</p>

	<p>An amusing illustration occurred lately in England, which was
	published as follows:—</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“When the address to the queen at the opening of the English
		royal courts was under consideration by the judges, one very eminent
		judge of appeal objected to the phrase ‘conscious as we are of
		our shortcomings.’ ‘I am not conscious of shortcomings,’ he said,
		‘and if I were I should not be so foolish as to say so;’ whereupon a
		learned lord justice blandly observed, ‘Suppose we say, “conscious as
		we are of each other’s shortcomings.”’”</p>

	<p>The very brief exposition of the structure and functions of the
	brain already given, may serve as an introduction to the subject and
	prepare the reader to appreciate the laborious investigations of many
	years, by means of which so comprehensive a science was brought
	into existence amid the hostile influences of established opinions and
	established ignorance.</p>

	<p>It is necessary now to present this statement to enable the reader
	to realize more fully the positive character of the science.</p>

	<p>My life has been devoted to the study of man, his destiny and his
	happiness. Uncontrolled in education, I learned to endure no mental
	restraint, and, thrown upon my own resources in boyhood, difficulties
	but strengthened the passion for philosophical knowledge.
	Yet more formidable difficulties were found in the limited condition
	of human science, alike in libraries and colleges.</p>

	<p>Anthropology, my favorite study, had no systematic development,
	and the very word was unfamiliar, because there was really nothing
	to which it could justly be applied. Its elementary sciences were in
	an undeveloped state, and some of them not yet in existence. Mental
	philosophy was very limited in its scope, and had little or nothing
	of a practical and scientific nature. The soul was not recognised as
	a subject for science. The body was studied apart from the soul, and
	the brain, the home of the soul, was enveloped in mystery—so as to
	leave even physiological science shrouded in darkness, as the central
	and controlling organ of life was considered an inaccessible mystery.
	In studying medicine, it seemed that I wandered through a wilderness
	without a compass and with no cardinal points.</p>

	<p>Phrenology promised much, and I examined it cautiously. It
	struck me at first as an unsatisfactory system of mental philosophy,
	and I stated my objections before its most celebrated and venerable
	champion, in public, who assured me that I would be satisfied by
	further investigation. As it seemed a very interesting department
	of natural science, I began by comparing the heads of my acquaintances
	with the phrenological map, and discovering so many striking
	coincidences that I was gradually satisfied as to its substantial truth,
	and I do not believe that any one has ever thus tested the discoveries
	of Gall and Spurzheim, without perceiving their <em>general</em> correctness,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>while many, with less critical observation, have accepted them
	as absolutely true.</p>

	<p>My interest increased with the extent of my observations, until,
	for several years, I abandoned practical medicine for the exclusive
	study of the science of the brain in the great volume of nature,
	with the doctrines of Gall as the basis of the investigation. As it
	was my purpose to seek the deficiencies as well as the merits of the
	new science, I tested its accuracy by the careful examination of living
	heads and skulls in comparison with ascertained character, and
	with the anatomy of the brain, not forgetting the self-evident principles
	of mental philosophy. Many thousand critical examinations
	were made between the years 1834 and 1841, leading to many positive
	conclusions. The first year’s observations made me distinctly
	aware and certain of several defects in the doctrines, as to the functions
	ascribed to certain localities of the brain to which were ascribed,
	Mirthfulness, Acquisitiveness, Adhesiveness, Constructiveness,
	Tune, Ideality, Combativeness, Destructiveness, and Cautiousness.
	The functions of these localities were evidently misunderstood, and
	the faculties erroneously located.</p>

	<p>The external senses were omitted from the catalogue of cerebral
	organs, though evidently entitled to recognition, and the physiological
	powers of the brain, the prime mover and most important part
	of the constitution, were almost totally ignored.</p>

	<p>Following the old route of exploration by cranioscopy, I sought to
	supply these defects. I found the supposed Mirthfulness to be a planning
	and reasoning organ, and the true Mirthfulness to be located
	more interiorly. Acquisitiveness was evidently located farther back.
	The so-called organ of Adhesiveness appeared to be incapable of
	manifesting true friendship, and its absence was frequently accompanied
	by strong capacities for friendship, of a disinterested
	character. Constructiveness appeared to be located too low, and
	too far back, running into the middle lobe, which is not the place
	for intellect. Tune did not appear to correspond regularly to
	musical talent. Many of the higher functions ascribed to Ideality
	were conspicuous in heads which had that organ small, with a large
	development just above it. Combativeness had evidently less
	influence upon physical courage than was supposed, for it was
	sometimes well developed in cowards, and rather small in brave men.
	Cautiousness was evidently not the organ of fear, for the bravest
	men, of whom I met many in the southwest, sometimes had it in
	predominant development, and in the timid it was sometimes
	moderate, or small. Destructiveness was frequently a characteristic
	of narrow heads (indeed this is the case with the Thugs of India),
	and a broad development above the ears was sometimes accompanied
	by a mild disposition. The height of the head above the ears did
	not prove a correct criterion of moral character, nor did the breadth
	indicate correctly the amount of the selfish and violent passions.</p>

	<p>I observed that the violent and selfish elements of character were
	connected with occipital depth, and elongation; that the affections
	were connected with the coronal region, that the sense of vision was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>located in the brow, and the sense of feeling in the temples, near
	the cheekbone, that the upper occipital region was the seat of
	energetic powers, and the lower, of violent or criminal impulses, and
	that the whole cerebrum was an apparatus of mingling convolutions,
	in which the functions, gradually changing from point to point,
	presented throughout a beautiful blending and connection.</p>

	<p>Observing daily the comparative development of brain and body,
	with their reciprocal influence, I traced the outlines of cerebral
	physiology, and the laws of sympathetic connection or correspondence
	between the body and the encephalon, by which, in a given
	constitution, I would determine from the head the development of
	the whole body, the peculiar distributions of the circulation, with
	the consequent morbid tendencies, the relative perfection of the
	different senses and different organs of the body, and the character
	of the temperament.</p>

	<p>Seeking continually for the fundamental laws of Anthropology,
	criticising and rejecting all that appeared objectionable or inconsistent,
	I acquired possession of numerous sound and comprehensive
	principles concerning the fundamental laws of cerebral science,
	which were at once touchstones for truth and efficient instruments for
	further research.</p>

	<p>These fundamental laws, though very obvious and easily perceived
	when pointed out, had been overlooked by my predecessors, but are
	always accepted readily by my auditors, when fully explained. As
	new facts and principles led to the discovery of other facts and principles,
	a system of philosophy (not speculative, but scientific) was
	thus evolved, and a number of geometrical principles were established
	as the basis of the science of the brain, so evidently true,
	though so long overlooked, as to command the unanimous assent
	of all to whom they have been presented; and, as the acceptance of
	these principles involves the general acceptance of cerebral science,
	my labors as a teacher have ever been singularly harmonious, and
	free from doubt, antagonism, and contention.</p>

	<p>The fundamental principle of the philosophy was geometric or
	mathematical, as it examined the construction of the brain, and
	showed an exact mathematical relation between each organ of the
	brain and its effects on the body, in the spontaneous gestures, the
	circulation of blood, the nervous forces, and local functions. Its
	leading characteristic being the law of the expression of the vital
	forces and feelings in outward acts. This doctrine was called the
	<strong class="emphasis">Pathognomic System</strong>.</p>

	<p>I was preparing to publish in several volumes the reorganized
	science as the Pathognomic System, when the consummation of my
	researches, by a brilliant discovery, led me into a new world of
	knowledge—to the full development of the science of Anthropology,
	according to which the brain gives organic expression to functions
	which are essentially located in the soul, and the body gives
	organic manifestation to functions which are controlled in the brain,
	while the body reacts upon the brain and the brain upon the soul.
	Thus, every element of humanity has a triple representation—that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>in the soul, which is purely psychic, yet by its influence becomes
	physiological in the body; that in the body which is purely physiological,
	yet by its influence becomes psychic in the soul, and that in
	the brain which produces physiological effects in the body, and
	psychic effects in the soul.</p>

	<p>Thus, each of the three repositories of power is a psycho-physiological
	representation of the man; more physical in the body, more
	spiritual in the soul, but in the brain a more perfect psycho-physiological
	representation of man as he is in the present life. This full
	conception of the brain, which Gall did not attain, involved the new
	science of <strong class="emphasis">Cerebral Physiology</strong>, in which the brain may express
	the character of the body, as well as the soul, of which I would only
	say at present that my first observations were directed to ascertaining
	the cerebral seats of the external senses, vision, hearing and feeling,
	and the influences of different portions of the brain on different
	portions of the body.</p>

	<p>The location of the sense of feeling, of which I became absolutely
	certain in 1838, at the base of the middle lobe has since been substantially
	confirmed by Ferrier’s experiment on the monkey; but I
	have not been concerned about the results of vivisection, knowing
	that if I have made a true discovery, vivisection and pathology
	must necessarily confirm it; and I am not aware that any of
	my discoveries have been disturbed by the immense labors of
	vivisection.</p>

	<p>The discovery of the organ of the sense of feeling led to an investigation
	of its powers, and the phenomena exhibited when its development
	was unusually large—hence came the initial fact of
	psychometry. Early in 1841 I found a very large development of
	the organ, in the head of the late Bishop Polk, then at Little Rock,
	the capital of Arkansas, who subsequently became a confederate
	general. After explaining to him his great sensibility to atmospheric,
	electric, and all other physical conditions, he mentioned a still more
	remarkable sensibility—that whenever he touched brass, he had
	immediately the taste of brass in his mouth, whether he knew what
	he was touching or not. I lost no time in verifying this observation
	by many experiments upon other persons, and finding that there
	were many in whom sensibility was developed to this extent, so that
	when I placed pieces of metal in their hands, behind their backs,
	they could tell what the metal was by its taste, or some other
	impression. Further examinations showed that substances of any
	kind, held in the hands of sensitives, yielded not only an impression
	upon the sense of taste, by which they might be recognized, but an
	impression upon the entire sensibility of the body. Medicines tried
	in this manner gave a distinct impression—as distinct as if they had
	been swallowed—to a majority of the members of a large medical
	class, in the leading medical school at Cincinnati, and to those who
	had superior psychometric capacities, the impression given in this
	manner enabled them to describe the qualities and effects of the
	medicines as fully and accurately as they are given in the works on
	materia medica.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>This method of investigation I consider not only vastly more easy
	and rapid than the method adopted by the followers of Hahnemann,
	but more accurate and efficient than any other method known to the
	medical profession, and destined, therefore, to produce a greater
	improvement in our knowledge of the materia medica than we can
	derive from all other methods combined, in the same length of time.
	I may hereafter publish the practical demonstration of this, but the
	vast amount of labor involved in my experimental researches has
	not yet permitted me to take up this department, although it has
	yielded me some very valuable discoveries.</p>

	<p>It may require a century for mankind fully to realize the value of
	Psychometry. It has been clearly, though I cannot say completely
	shown in the “<cite class="name">Manual of Psychometry</cite>,” to which I would
	refer the reader. I would simply state that the scientific discovery
	and exposition of Psychometry is equivalent to the dawn of new
	intellectual civilization, since it enables us to advance rapidly
	toward perfection all sciences and forms of knowledge now known,
	and to introduce new sciences heretofore unknown.</p>

	<p>The foregoing were the initial steps and results in the development
	of Psychometry, simultaneously accompanied by those other
	discoveries in 1841, the scope and magnitude of which appear to me
	and to those who have studied my demonstrations, to be far more
	important than anything that has ever been discovered or done in
	Biological science, being nothing less than a complete scientific
	demonstration of the functions of the brain in all its psycho-physiological
	relations. To appreciate their transcendent importance, it is
	necessary only to know that the experiments have been carefully
	made, have often been repeated during the past forty-five years, and
	that all they demonstrate may also be demonstrated by other means,
	and fully established, if no such experiments could be made.</p>

	<p>The origin of this discovery was as follows. My advanced investigations
	of the brain, between 1835 and 1841, had added so much
	to the incomplete and inaccurate discoveries of Gall, and had
	brought cerebral science into so much closer and more accurate
	relation with cerebral anatomy and embryology, as illustrated by
	Tiedemann, that I became profoundly aware of the position in which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>I found myself, as an explorer, possessed of knowledge previously
	quite unknown, and yet, at the same time, however true, not strictly
	demonstrable, since none could fully realize its truth without following
	the same path and studying with the same concentrated devotion
	the comparative development of the brain in men and animals.
	Such zeal, success, and assiduity I did not believe could be expected.
	There might not be one man in a century to undertake such a task
	(for all the centuries of civilization had produced but one such man—the
	illustrious Gall), and when he appeared his voice would not
	be decisive. I would, therefore, appear not as presenting positive
	knowledge, but as contributing another theory, which the medical
	profession, regardless of my labors, would treat as a mere hypothesis.<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="I would mention..." class="fnmarker">1</a></p>

	<p>It was absolutely necessary that the functions of the brain should
	be demonstrated as positively as those of the spinal nerves had been
	demonstrated by Majendie and Bell. Two methods appeared possible.
	The two agents were galvanism and the aura of the nervous
	system, commonly called animal magnetism. My first experiments
	in 1841, satisfied me that both were available, but that the <em>nervaura</em>
	was far more available, efficient, and satisfactory. Upon this I have
	relied ever since, though I sometimes experiment with galvanism, to
	demonstrate its efficiency, and Dr. De la Rua, of Cuba, informed me
	over twenty years ago that he found very delicate galvanic currents
	available for this purpose in his practice.</p>

	<p>Animal magnetism or mesmerism had been involved in mystery
	and empiricism. There had never been any scientific or anatomical
	explanation of the phenomena, and this mystery I desired to dispel.
	My first step was to ascertain that for experiments on the nervous
	system we did not need the somnambulic or hypnotic condition, and
	that it was especially to be avoided as a source of confusion and
	error. Whenever the organ of sensibility, or sensitiveness, was
	sufficiently developed and predominant, the conditions of neurological
	experiments for scientific purposes were satisfactory, and to
	make such experiments, the subjects, instead of being ignorant,
	passive, emotional, hysteric, or inclined to trance, should be as
	intelligent as possible, well-balanced and clear-headed,—competent
	to observe subjective phenomena in a critical manner. Hence, my
	experiments, which have been made upon all sorts of persons, were
	most decisive and satisfactory to myself when made upon well-educated
	physicians, upon medical professors, my learned colleagues,
	upon eminent lawyers or divines, upon strong-minded farmers or
	hunters, entirely unacquainted with such subjects, and incapable of
	psychological delusion, or upon persons of very skeptical minds who
	would not admit anything until the phenomena were made very
	plain and unquestionable.</p>

	<p>While the nervaura of the human constitution (which is as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>distinctly perceptible to the sensitive as its caloric and electricity)
	is emitted from every portion of the surface of the head and body,
	the quality and quantity of that which is emitted from the inner
	surface of the hand, render it most available, and the application of
	the hand of any one who has a respectable amount of vital and mental
	energy, will produce a distinct local stimulation of functions wherever
	it may be applied upon the head or body. In this manner it
	is easy to demonstrate the amiable and pleasing influence of the
	superior regions of the brain, the more energetic and vitalizing
	influence of its posterior half, and the mild, subduing influence of
	the front.</p>

	<p>In my first experiments, in the spring of 1841, I found so great
	susceptibility that I could demonstrate promptly even the smallest
	organs of the brain, and it was gratifying to find that the illustrious
	Gall had ascertained, with so marvellous accuracy the functions of
	the smallest organs in the front lobe, and the subject could be
	engrossed in the thought of numbers and counting by touching the
	organ of number or calculation. Eagerly did I proceed in testing
	the accuracy of all the discoveries of Gall and the additions I had
	made by craniological studies, as well as bringing out new functions
	which I had not been able to anticipate or discover. Omitting the
	history of those experiments, I would but briefly state that in 1842
	I published a complete map of the brain, in which the full development
	of human faculties made a complete picture of the psycho-physiological
	constitution of man, and thus presented for the first
	time a science which might justly be called <em>Anthropology</em>.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="I do not publish or circulate..." class="fnmarker">2</a></p>

	<p>It is obvious that prior to 1842 there was nothing entitled to the
	name of <strong class="emphasis">Anthropology</strong>, as there was no complete geography
	before the discovery of America and circumnavigation of the globe.
	When man is fully portrayed by the statement of all the psychic and
	all the physiological faculties and functions found in his brain, which
	contains the totality, and manifests them in the soul and body, it
	is obvious that we have a true Anthropology, which, to complete its
	fulness, requires only the study of the soul as an entity distinct
	from the brain, and of the body as an anatomical and physiological
	apparatus. The latter had already been well accomplished by the
	medical profession, and the former very imperfectly by spiritual
	psychologists. But neither the physiology, nor the pneumatology
	had been placed in organic connection with the central cerebral
	science.</p>

	<p>In consummating such tasks, I felt justified, in 1842, in adopting
	the word Anthropology, as the representative of the new science,
	though at that time it was so unfamiliar as to be misunderstood.
	This science, as presented in my Outlines of Anthropology in 1854,
	embraced another very important and entirely novel discovery—the
	psycho-physiological relations of the surface of the body, the manner
	in which every portion of the body responds to the brain and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>soul, the final solution of the great and hitherto impenetrable
	mystery of the triune relations of soul, brain, and body. This
	discovery, constituting the science of Sarcognomy, became the basis
	of a new medical philosophy, explaining the influence of the body on
	the soul, in health, and disease, and the reciprocal influence of the
	soul on the body.</p>

	<p>This manifestly modified our views of therapeutics and revolutionized
	electro-therapeutics by pointing out the exact physiological and
	psychic effects of every portion of the surface of the body, when
	subject to local treatment, and hence, originating new methods of
	electric practice, in which many results were produced not heretofore
	deemed possible. All this was fully presented in my work on
	<cite class="name">Therapeutic Sarcognomy</cite>, published in 1885, which was speedily
	sold.</p>

	<p>In contemplating these immense results of a successful investigation
	of the functions of the brain, I can see no logical escape from
	the conclusion that such a revelation of the functions of the brain is
	by far the most important event that belongs to the history of vital
	science—an event so romantically different from the common, slow
	progress of science when cultivated by men of ability, that I do not
	wonder at the incredulity which naturally opposes its recognition,
	and seems to render the most unanimous and conclusive testimony
	from honorable scientists apparently ineffective. The support of the
	medical college in which I was Dean of the Faculty, the hearty
	endorsement by the Faculty of Indiana State University, and by
	numerous committees of investigation, seem to count as nothing
	with the conservative portion of the medical profession, who have
	ever understood how to ignore so simple and positive a demonstration
	as that of Harvey, or so practical a demonstration as that of
	Hahnemann, or so irresistible a mass of facts as those of modern
	psychic science.</p>

	<p>The question will naturally arise among the enlightened lovers of
	truth, why so grand and so <em>demonstrable</em> a science should for forty-five
	years have made so little progress toward general recognition.
	It is sufficient to say that new and revolutionary truth is never
	welcomed, and, if the discoverer is not active as a propagandist it
	has no diffusion. I did not feel that there was any receptiveness
	across the ocean for what was resisted here. Nevertheless I did
	prepare and send to Edinburgh, in 1841, a brief report of my
	discoveries accompanied by an endorsement or introduction from the
	venerable Prof. Caldwell, the founder of the successful medical
	college at Louisville, whose lectures were attended by four hundred
	pupils. I supposed the gentlemen of the Phrenological Society at
	Edinburgh the most liberal parties in Great Britain, but they
	declined publishing my memoir as <em>too marvellous</em>, and proposed
	merely to file it away as a caveat of the discovery. That ended all
	thoughts of Europe; and, indeed, it seemed to me premature to urge
	such a discovery and so grand a philosophy upon the world in the
	present state of its intellectual civilization. I ceased to agitate the
	subject for many years, and allowed myself to be drawn into the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>political agitations connected with our civil war, to mitigate some of
	its social and political evils.</p>

	<p>Of late, however, an urgent and imperative sense of duty has put
	my pen in motion as the remnant of my life will be hardly sufficient
	to record the results of my investigations.</p>

	<p>In the “New Education” and the “Manual of Psychometry—the
	dawn of a new civilization”—I have appealed to the public, and
	three editions of the former with two of the latter show that the
	public is not indifferent. The recognition of the marvellous claims
	of Psychometry will prepare the way for the supreme science of
	Anthropology, to which the coming century will do justice.</p>

	<p>In justice to the learned Prof. Caldwell and myself, I should not
	omit to mention that this distinguished, eloquent, and venerable gentleman,
	who, in his early life, was a cotemporary of the famous Dr.
	Rush, of Philadelphia, and throughout his life was a champion of
	the most progressive doctrines in Biology, not only gave his friendly
	co-operation on the first presentation of my discoveries, but ten years
	later honored me with a visit at Cincinnati, to become more fully
	acquainted with them, and subsequently, by appointment of the
	National Medical Association, prepared a report upon subjects of a
	kindred nature, in which he incorporated a statement of my discoveries.
	His subsequent illness and death, in 1854, at an advanced
	age, prevented the delivery of this memoir.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In signal contrast to the honorable and candid course of Prof. <strong class="name">Caldwell</strong>, and
		to the candid examination, followed by eulogistic language of Prof. <strong class="name">H. P. Gatchell</strong>,
		<strong class="name">Robert Dale Owen</strong>, President <strong class="name">Andrew Wylie</strong>, Rev. <strong class="name">John Pierpont</strong>, Dr. <strong class="name">Samuel</strong>
		<strong class="name">Forry</strong>, Prof. <strong class="name">Wm. Denton</strong>, the eloquent Judge <strong class="name">Rowan</strong>, and a score of other
		eminently intellectual men, it is my duty to record the melancholy fact that the
		great majority of professional men, when tested, have manifested an entire apathy,
		if not a positive aversion, to the investigations and discoveries in which these
		momentous results have been reached. While no aversion, disrespect, or suspicion
		was shown toward myself, a stubborn aversion was shown to investigations
		that might have revolutionary results—proving that our false systems of education
		teach men not to think independently, but to adhere closely to precedent
		authority, fashion, popularity, and <em>habit</em>, which is the inertia of the mental world.</p>

		<p>The faculty of my alma mater (excepting Prof. Caldwell) refused to investigate
		the subject, even when invited by their Board of Trustees. The Boston Academy
		of Arts and Sciences, embracing the men at the head of the medical profession,
		pretended to take up the subject, but in a few hours dropped it, with polite compliments
		to myself, in 1842. The American Medical Association, in 1878, refused
		to entertain the subject because I could not coincide with them in my sentiments,
		and accept their code of bigotry. There was no formal action of the Association,
		but my friend, Prof. Gross, then recognized as the Nestor of the profession, and
		holding the highest position of authority, informed me semi-officially, very courteously,
		that none of my discoveries could ever be brought to the notice of the
		Association, because I did not accept their code. Thus (without mentioning other
		instances), I have stood before the public with a <em>demonstrable</em> science, challenging
		investigation by critical opponents, who have so uniformly evaded or shrunk from
		the test that I have ceased to care for their opinions, while I still entertain as
		profound a respect as ever for the investigations of the candid and manly, among
		whom I never fail to find friendship and cordiality.</p>

		<p>Looking back forty-five years, I remember with extreme pleasure the friendly
		co-operation of <strong class="name">Rowan</strong> and <strong class="name">Caldwell</strong>. The American medical profession never
		had a more dignified, imposing, and high-toned representative than Prof. Caldwell.
		Nor was the legal profession anywhere ever adorned by a more commanding and
		gracious representative than the unsurpassed advocate, <strong class="name">Rowan</strong>, who was widely
		known as the “<strong class="name">Old Monarch</strong>.” The nobility of such men was shown in their
		noble bearing toward a dawning science, In which they saw the grandeur of the
		future.</p>

		<h3>COLLEGE OF THERAPEUTICS.</h3>

		<p class="ad_pstyle_3">Next Session Begins November 1, 1887.</p>

		<p>This institution is the germ of what will be an
		immense revolution in education hereafter, when
		the knowledge now given to small classes will hold
		a conspicuous place in every college, and will be
		presented in every high school.</p>

		<p>The mountain mass of inertia, which opposes, passively,
		all fundamental changes, cannot now resist
		scientific demonstration as it has in the past.
		The instruction in the College of Therapeutics, is
		thoroughly demonstrative, leaving no room for
		doubt, and it gives a species of knowledge which
		ought to be a part of every one’s education—a
		knowledge of the constitution of man, not obtainable
		to-day in any medical or literary college, nor
		in our mammoth libraries. It is not merely as a
		deep philosophy that this interests us, but as a
		guide in the preservation of health, and in the
		regulation of spiritual phenomena, which would, to
		a very great extent, supersede our reliance on the
		medical profession by giving us the control of the
		vital powers, by which we may protect ourselves,
		and control the development of the young.</p>

		<p>Each student was made to feel the effects of local
		treatment on the body, and the power of rapidly
		changing disease to health, and was personally
		taught to perform the manipulations for this purpose,
		and to investigate disease or portray character
		by the psychometric methods as well as to test
		the value of medicines.</p>

		<p>The various uses and scientific application of
		electricity were shown, and many things entirely
		unknown and unrecognized in works on Electro-Therapeutics.
		The entire class was placed under
		a medical influence simultaneously by the agency
		of electricity—an operation so marvelous that it
		would be considered incredible in medical colleges.
		By these and other experiments and numerous
		illustrations and lucid explanations of the brain
		and nervous system, the instruction was made
		deeply interesting, and students have attended
		more than one course to perfect themselves in
		the science. The following declaration of sentiments
		shows how the course was regarded by the
		class:</p>

		<p>“The summer class of 1887 in the College of
		Therapeutics, feeling it their duty to add their
		testimony to that of many others in reference to
		the grand scientific discoveries which they have
		seen thoroughly demonstrated by Prof. J. R.
		Buchanan, would say to the public that no one can
		attend such a course of instruction as we have recently
		been engaged in, without realizing that
		Therapeutic Sarcognomy greatly enlarges the practical
		resources of the healing art for the medical
		practitioner, magnetizer and electro-therapeutist,
		while Psychometry, whose positive truths we have
		tested and proven, like the sun’s rays, illumines
		all the dark problems of medical practice and of
		psycho-physiological sciences.</p>

		<p>“Therapeutic Sarcognomy explains the very intricate
		and mysterious relations of the soul, the brain
		and body, which prior to Prof. Buchanan’s discoveries
		were unknown to all scientific teachers,
		and are even now only known to his students and
		the readers of his works,</p>

		<p>“We feel that we have been very fortunate in finding
		so valuable a source of knowledge, whose future
		benefits to the human race, in many ways, cannot
		be briefly stated, and we would assure all who may
		attend this college, or read the published works of
		Prof. Buchanan, and his monthly, the <cite>Journal of
		Man</cite>, that they will, when acquainted with the subject,
		be ready to unite with us in appreciating and
		honoring the greatest addition ever made to biological
		and psychological sciences. Hoping that the time
		is not for distant when all students in medical colleges
		may obtain access to this most important
		knowledge, we give our testimony to the public.”</p>

		<h3>MAYO’S ANÆSTHETIC.</h3>

		<p>The suspension of pain, under dangerous surgical
		operations, is the greatest triumph of Therapeutic
		Science in the present century. It came
		first by mesmeric hypnotism, which was applicable
		only to a few, and was restricted by the jealous
		<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>hostility of the old medical profession. Then
		came the nitrous oxide, introduced by Dr. Wells,
		of Hartford, and promptly discountenanced by the
		enlightened (?) medical profession of Boston, and
		set aside for the next candidate, ether, discovered
		in the United States also, but far interior to the
		nitrous oxide as a safe and pleasant agent. This was
		largely superseded by chloroform, discovered much
		earlier by Liebig and others, but introduced as an
		anæsthetic in 1847, by Prof. Simpson. This proved
		to be the most powerful and dangerous of all.
		Thus the whole policy of the medical profession
		was to discourage the safe, and encourage the more
		dangerous agents. The magnetic sleep, the most
		perfect of all anæsthetic agents, was expelled from
		the realm of college authority; ether was substituted
		for nitrous oxide, and chloroform preferred to
		ether, until frequent deaths gave warning.</p>

		<p>Nitrous oxide, much the safest of the three, has
		not been the favorite, but has held its ground,
		especially with dentists. But even nitrous oxide is
		not perfect. It is not equal to the magnetic sleep,
		when the latter is practicable, but fortunately it is
		applicable to all. To perfect the nitrous oxide,
		making it universally safe and pleasant, Dr. U. K.
		Mayo, of Boston, has combined it with certain
		harmless vegetable nervines, which appear to control
		the fatal tendency which belongs to all anæsthetics
		when carried too far. The success of Dr.
		Mayo, in perfecting our best anæsthetic, is amply
		attested by those who have used it. Dr. Thorndike,
		than whom, Boston had no better surgeon, pronounced
		it “the safest the world has yet seen.”
		It has been administered to children and to patients
		in extreme debility. Drs. Frizzell and Williams,
		say they have given it “repeatedly in heart disease,
		severe lung diseases, Bright’s disease, etc., where
		the patients were so feeble as to require assistance
		in walking, many of them under medical treatment,
		and the results have been all that we could
		ask—no irritation, suffocation, nor depression.
		We heartily commend it to all as the anæsthetic of
		the age.” Dr. Morrill, of Boston, administered
		Mayo’s anæsthetic to his wife with delightful
		results when “her lungs were so badly disorganized,
		that the administration of ether or gas
		would be entirely unsafe.” The reputation of this
		anæsthetic is now well established; in fact, it is
		not only safe and harmless, but has great medical
		virtue for daily use in many diseases, and is coming
		into use for such purposes. In a paper before
		the Georgia State Dental Society, Dr. E. Parsons
		testified strongly to its superiority. “The nitrous
		oxide, (says Dr. P.) causes the patient when fully
		under its influence to have very like the appearance
		of a corpse,” but under this new anæsthetic
		“the patient appears like one in a natural sleep.”
		The language of the press, generally has been highly

		<p class="ad_pstyle_1">Mayo’s Vegetable Anæsthetic.</p>

		<p>A perfectly safe and pleasant substitute for chloroform,
		ether, nitrous oxide gas, and all other
		anæsthetics. Discovered by Dr. U. K. Mayo, April,
		1883, and since administered by him and others in
		over 300,000 cases successfully. The youngest child,
		the most sensitive lady, and those having heart
		disease, and lung complaint, inhale this vapor with
		impunity. It stimulates the circulation of the
		blood and builds up the tissues. Indorsed by the
		highest authority in the professions, recommended
		in midwifery and all cases of nervous prostration.
		Physicians, surgeons, dentists and private families
		supplied with this vapor, liquefied, in cylinders of
		various capacities. It should be administered the
		same as Nitrous Oxide, but it does not produce
		headache and nausea as that sometimes does. For
		further information pamphlets, testimonials, etc.,
		apply to</p>
